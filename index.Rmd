## Introduction

The Chick Weight Shiny Application is an exciting new online application that can do a number of things:
* It shows the weight of chicks with 4 different diets
* It allows you to select which diet(s) to view
* It shows a combined plot of weight per chicken per diet
* Shows a faceted plot of weight per chicken per diet
* Shows the average weight per diet



--- .class #id 

## Example of the combined plot
```{r echo=FALSE}

p <- qplot(Time, 
    weight, 
    data = ChickWeight,      
    colour = Diet,
    main = "Chick Weight per diet",
    xlab = "Time",
    ylab = "Chick Weight (gram)") 
print(p)
 

```

--- .class #id 

## Example of the Faceted plot
```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- qplot(Time, 
     weight,
     data = ChickWeight,
     colour = Diet,
     facets = . ~ Diet,
     main = "Chick Weight per diet",
     xlab = "Time",
     ylab = "Chick Weight (gram)") 
    
print(p) 
```
--- .class #id
